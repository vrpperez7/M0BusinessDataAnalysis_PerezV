Using Excel and Python, I pulled data from NYC Open Data to analyze Shop Healthy’s program “Retail Challenge” and seeing participating stores’ location to make informed decisions about obesity in NYC boroughs. Also, looking at NYC.gov’s obesity data to find correlations between Shop Healthy and obesity rates.

I filtered Shop Healthy and NYC.gov by borough data and used this to brainstorm ideas of what Shop Healthy’s goals are, which are potentially reducing obesity by promoting healthier food in delis. I then filtered both datasets to show between the years of 2013-2022 to have matching dates on both datasets. Using Excel I was able to create pivot tables to easily view and change filters if need be.

# **Business Question:**
# Can we promote Shop Healthy NYC’s Retail Challenge as a program that lowers obesity rates in NYC boroughs?
